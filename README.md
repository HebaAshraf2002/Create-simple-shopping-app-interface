# Overview

# What This Code Does
1. Main Page Layout:

- A vertically scrollable body divided into sections: "Our Products," "Browse Products," and "Hot Offers."
2. Product Carousel:
- A horizontally scrollable slider showcasing product images.
3. Product Grid:
- A grid displaying product images and names.
- Each product includes an "Add to Cart" button that shows a notification when clicked.
4. Hot Offers Section:
- A horizontally scrollable list of promotional offers with images and titles
# How the Code Works
1. Starting the App:
- The entry point is the main function, where the MyApp widget is launched.
- The MyApp widget sets up the app's theme and directs users to the main page (MyHomePage).
2. Building the Main Page:
- The MyHomePage widget, a StatefulWidget, takes care of constructing the primary interface.
- Inside, a ListView arranges the content sections, making the page scrollable and easy to navigate.
3. Creating the Product Carousel:
- A PageView widget is used to create a horizontal slider that cycles through product images.
- The images are fetched from the images directory and displayed with BoxFit.cover for an appealing look.
4. Displaying the Product Grid:
- The grid is built using GridView.builder, which dynamically creates cards for products.
- Each card includes:
  - A product image loaded from the assets.
  - A title showing the product name.
  - An "Add to Cart" button that triggers a SnackBar message to confirm the action.
5. Highlighting Hot Offers:
- A ListView.builder creates a horizontally scrolling list of promotional items.
- Each item features an offer image and a title, laid out neatly with a touch of padding.
6. Handling User Interaction:
- The app relies on the StatefulWidget to manage interactivity.
- clicking the "Add to Cart" button displays a SnackBar notification at the bottom of the screen, giving users immediate feedback.
